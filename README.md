Rebellion Reboot is a space odyssey RPG created for Android and PC.
\
It follows the story of a pilot who's decisions change the course of each system they visit.
\
You are presented with three characters to choose from, each one with a different back story, traits, benefits, and ship choices.
\
Rebellion Reboot was the second game I created on the Unity game engine using Blender and C#.
